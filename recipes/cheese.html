  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe on how to make cheese from scratch. Even though this may be overwhelming,<br> but you definitley do not need to be a farmer or have a factory to produce one for yourself.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, it is essentially true that farmers make the best of authentic cheese products,<br> particularly beacuse they have the resources at their disposal and their environment is almost perfect for making organic cheese.<br> Non-farmers can adjust to make the best of homemade cheese.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 gallon whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
        <li>Heat milk in a large pot until the temperature reaches 90 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Stir constantly to prevent scorching on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, immediately pour the vinegar and stir.</li>
        <li>Wait up to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Line a mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set over a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir salt into milk; pour through the prepared strainer. Let curds strain for 1 hour.<br> The milk should separate into a white solid part and a yellowish liquid (whey). Discard the whey</li>
        <li>Pat cheese into a ball and remove the cheesecloth.</li>
        <li>Wrap in plastic and store in the refrigerator until ready to use.<br> Fresh cheese will usually last about 1 week.</li>
        
    </ol>
